# GitHub Sydney Developer Data Analysis
-To gather this data, I leveraged the GitHub API to filter users in Sydney with more than 100 followers. I extracted detailed information from their profiles, cleaned up company names, and retrieved up to 500 repositories per user to analyze their activity, popularity, and engagement.

-The most surprising finding from this analysis was the discovery that follower count does not strongly correlate with the number of repositories. Many users with fewer repositories had high follower counts, indicating that factors beyond repository quantity—such as project visibility, contributions, or specialization—play a significant role in attracting followers.

-For developers aiming to increase their GitHub influence, focusing on quality over quantity is essential. Creating well-documented projects, choosing popular licenses, and engaging with the community (e.g., through contributions to other repositories) can be more effective for gaining followers than simply increasing the number of repositories.
